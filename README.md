# RGB-Color-Game
The RGB Color game project is an idea from the Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course

This was very fun to build, I also added my own twist to it adding a hard mode with 16 colors!

You are Provided with an RGB color code, your task is to guess what color does the code represent by clicking the color squares.

You can play on Easy, Normal and Hard Mode.

Have fun and enjoy
